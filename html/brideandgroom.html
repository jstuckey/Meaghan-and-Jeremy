    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Meaghan and Jeremy met on <time datetime="2006-02-18">February 18, 2006</time> while hanging out with mutual friends in a cluttered, dimly lit dorm room of Chestertown Hall at the University of Maryland College Park. Reluctantly partnered for the evening's activities, they engaged in affable yet mundane conversation throughout the night. Despite these less-than-idyllic circumstances, Meaghan piqued Jeremy's interest enough for him to chase after her as she was leaving to ask for her last name.

        In neighboring Bel Air Hall, Meaghan later attempted in vain to find Jeremy on Facebook, mistakenly searching for his nickname: Jeremiah. With proper guidance from their friend Schade, Meaghan eventually contacted Jeremy and asked to meet for breakfast the following morning. Jeremy, having been properly briefed by Schade, was awaiting Meaghan's message and agreed to attend.

        After that breakfast at the Silver Diner, Meaghan and Jeremy saw each other a few more times, including a date to see the <em>Vagina Monologues</em> chaperoned by Meaghan's friend Laura. On the evening of <time datetime="2006-03-04">March 4, 2006</time>, Meaghan came over to Jeremy's room in Baltimore Hall. As <em>Tiny Dancer</em> played in the background, Jeremy sat taciturn and nervous until he finally set his anxiety aside and asked Meaghan out. To his relief, Meaghan immediately accepted. From there they walked across campus back to Chestertown Hall, this time as boyfriend and girlfriend.

        As their relationship developed, the two quickly discovered a distinct contrast in their personal interests. Meaghan enjoyed dance, musicals, clothes, and baking. Jeremy preferred videogames, camping, computers, and snow/wakeboarding. Musical taste was beyond reconciliation. Meaghan touched on the finer points of freshwater biology, while Jeremy tried to explain computer science as exoterically as possible. Jeremy was especially morose to learn that Meaghan was a Yankees fan. This blow was somewhat mitigated by Meaghan's adoption of Jeremy's hockey team and their mutual support of Maryland athletics. Despite all their differences, the two managed to persevere.

        The college years that followed were filled with a mixture of classes, parties, work, formals, studying, and socializing. Meaghan and Jeremy divided time between their two places, making frequent treks across College Park to visit each other. Meaghan established herself as a regular at Jeremy's townhouse. Often the only female in a house of seven males, her presence invited comparisons to Snow White. They began attending Maryland basketball and football games together on a regular basis.

        While at school, Meaghan and Jeremy worked on campus as kitchen staff at Adele's restaurant. Adele's could most accurately be described as a group of friends hanging out together on weeknights while earning a meager salary and free food. Jeremy had the misfortune of working as Meaghan's subordinate. Jeremy maintains that Meaghan's authority over him was simply patronization on his part. Meaghan begs to differ. Thursday nights, pre-shift meals, and biannual formals served as social gatherings for the Adele's crew throughout their time at Maryland.

        Spring beak senior year brought the closest approximation of a vacation the two have had to date. It began in New York City for their inaugural participation in the Dacey family pub crawl. They then endured a non-stop, twenty-hour drive down to Miami before spending a week in the sun with their friends.

        The gifts exchanged between the two over the years hint at the ineffable qualities of their relationship. Meaghan's dogged pursuit of a Nintendo Wii shortly after launch. Jeremy's tarnished dignity at the Build-a-Bear Workshop acquiring a stuffed penguin. Meaghan's surprise Orioles tickets in the midst of a stressful exam week. Jeremy's month-long concealment of a new television disguised only with a blanket. The gifts accrued over the course of many birthdays, Christmases, and anniversaries serve as tangible reminders of their desire to please one another.
    </p>
    <p>
        Post-graduation life found Meaghan and Jeremy in a peripatetic state of affairs as they traversed the I-270 corridor countless times. All told, Meaghan and Jeremy's relationship witnessed a total of eleven apartments in five Maryland towns. Eventually they moved in to a Germantown apartment across the street from Meaghan's future employer. Meaghan, Jeremy, and friends continued to tailgate for Maryland football games and founded a bar trivia team that met on a weekly basis. Jeremy continued his career as a software developer, while Meaghan earned her masters degree and began a new career teaching high school.

        Finally the day came when Jeremy was ready to propose. Due to Meaghan's penchant for ruining her own surprises, Jeremy went ring shopping in secrecy. Only Arnie the jeweler was privy to his plan. On the picturesque afternoon of <time datetime="2012-05-19">May 19, 2012</time>, Jeremy took Meaghan to College Park under the guise of a campus stroll and the proposition of D.P. Dough calzones for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
        With ring in cargo pocket, Jeremy led Meaghan to Baltimore Hall. Jeremy took Meaghan around back of the building, in view of his old dorm room and safely away from the prying eyes of vacating college students. It was here, where their journey began six years prior, that Jeremy proposed. They spent the remainder of the day revealing the news to family and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meaghan and Jeremy will be wed on <time datetime="2013-07-20">July 20, 2013</time>, a culmination of their seven year journey together.
