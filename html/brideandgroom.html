		Meaghan and Jeremy met on <time datetime="2006-02-18">February 18, 2006</time> while hanging out with mutual friends in a cluttered, dimly lit dorm room of Chestertown Hall at the University of Maryland College Park. Reluctantly partnered for the evening's activities, they engaged in affable yet mundane conversation throughout the night. Despite the less-than-idyllic circumstances of their first encounter, Meaghan piqued Jeremy's interest enough for him to chase after her as she was leaving to ask for her last name. In neighboring Bel Air Hall, Meaghan later attempted in vain to locate Jeremy on Facebook, mistakenly searching for his nickname: Jeremiah. With proper guidance from their friend Schade, Meaghan eventually contacted Jeremy and asked to meet for breakfast the following morning. Jeremy, having been properly briefed by Schade, was awaiting Meaghan's message and agreed to attend.

		After that breakfast at the Silver Diner, Meaghan and Jeremy saw each other a few more times, including a date to see the <em>Vagina Monologues</em> chaperoned by Meaghan's friend Laura. On the evening of <time datetime="2006-03-04">March 4, 2006</time>, Meaghan came over to Jeremy's room in Baltimore Hall. As <em>Tiny Dancer</em> played in the background, Jeremy sat taciturn and nervous until he finally set his anxiety aside and asked Meaghan out. To his relief, Meaghan immediately accepted. From there they walked across campus back to Chestertown Hall, this time as boyfriend and girlfriend.

		During the nascent period of their relationship, the two quickly discovered a distinct contrast in their personal interests. Meaghan preferred dancing to snowboarding. Jeremy preferred videogames to baking. Musical taste was beyond reconciliation. Meaghan touched on the finer points of freshwater biology, while Jeremy tried to explain computer science concepts as exoterically as possible. Jeremy was especially morose to learn that Meaghan was a Yankees fan, the franchise Jeremy despised most in all of sports. This blow was somewhat mitigated by Meaghan's adoption of Jeremy's hockey team and their mutual support of Maryland athletics. They managed to persevere despite their differences, and as their relationship matured, they even learned to draw solidarity from them.

		The college years that followed were filled with a mixture of classes, parties, work, formals, studying, and socializing. Meaghan and Jeremy divided time between their two places, making frequent treks across College Park to visit each other. Meaghan established herself as a regular at Jeremy's townhouse. Often the only female in a house of seven males, her presence invoked the role of Snow White. They began attending Maryland basketball and football games together on a regular basis. Spring beak senior year brought the closest approximation of a vacation the two have had to date. It began in New York City for their inaugural participation in the annual Dacey family pub crawl. They then endured a twenty hour drive down to Miami before spending a week in the sun with their friends.

		While at school, Meaghan and Jeremy worked on campus as kitchen staff at Adele's restaurant. Adele's could most accurately be described as a group of friends hanging out together on weeknights while earning a meager salary and free food. Jeremy had the misfortune of working as Meaghan's subordinate. Jeremy maintains that Meaghan's authority over him was purely patronization on his part. Meaghan begs to differ. Thursday nights, pre-shift meals, and biannual formals served as social gatherings for the Adele's crew throughout their time at Maryland.

		The gifts exchanged between the two over the years provide context for the ineffable qualities of their relationship. Meaghan's dogged pursuit of a Nintendo Wii shortly after console launch. Jeremy's tarnished dignity at the Build-a-Bear Workshop acquiring a stuffed Happy Feet penguin. Meaghan's surprise Orioles tickets in the midst of a stressful exam week. Jeremy's month-long concealment of a new television in plain sight. The gifts accrued over the course of many birthdays, Christmases, and anniversaries serve as tangible reminders of their desire to make each other happy.

		Post-graduation life found Meaghan and Jeremy in a peripatetic state of affairs, traversing the I-270 corridor countless times. All told, Meaghan and Jeremy's relationship witnessed a total of eleven apartments in five Maryland towns. Eventually, Meaghan and Jeremy moved in together to a Germantown apartment across the street from Meaghan's future employer. They hosted Friends Thanksgiving Dinner and even got a Christmas tree at Meaghan's insistence. Meaghan, Jeremy and friends continued to tailgate for Maryland football games and founded a bar trivia team. Jeremy continued his career as a software developer, while Meaghan earned her masters degree and began a new career teaching high school.
    </p>
    <p>
		Finally the day came when Jeremy was ready to propose. Due to Meaghan's proclivity to ruin her own surprises, Jeremy went ring shopping in secrecy. Only Arnie the jeweler was privy to his plan. On the picturesque afternoon of <time datetime="2012-05-19">May 19, 2012</time>, Jeremy took Meaghan to the College Park under the guise of a campus stroll and the proposition of D.P. Dough calzones for dinner. With ring in cargo pocket, Jeremy led Meaghan to Baltimore Hall where their journey began six years prior. Jeremy led Meaghan around back of the building, in view of his old dorm room and safely away from the prying eyes of vacating college students. It was here that became the site of their betrothal. They spent the remainder of the day revealing the news to jubilant family and friends. 
    </p>
    <p>
		Meaghan and Jeremy will be wed on <time datetime="2013-07-20">July 20, 2013</time>, a culmination of their seven-plus year journey together.
