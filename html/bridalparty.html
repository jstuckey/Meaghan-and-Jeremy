	<h3>Bryan Stuckey, <em>Best Man</em></h3>
	<p>
		Bryan and Jeremy met in 1988, when Bryan was born and Jeremy told his parents to "take him back." Believe it or not, Bryan is actually two years younger than Jeremy despite the height and beard growth differential. They have overcome bouts of hostility, both verbal and physical, over the years to become close today. Whether attending Orioles games, hitting the ski slopes, tailgating at Maryland, or working at Camp Oest, they are frequent companions in misadventure. Like Jake and Amir, they are Gullies For Life. Bryan was the first to inform Meaghan that she was accepted into the family since they took her crab picking, the Maryland symbol of acceptance.

	<h3>Tom Ports</h3>
	<p>
		Tom and Jeremy met in the summer of 2003 at Camp Oest when Jeremy offered to help a bowl-cut-sporting Tom with dripping candle wax into a bin of sawdust to create fire starters. They became good friends over four summers working together at Camp Oest and many events outside of camp. Whether painting the blue trail or getting a drink at Harvey's Jr., conversations inevitably turn to reminiscing about camp. They share a healthy appreciation for grilling, Natty Boh, and Teva sandals. Tom often allowed Jeremy to call Meaghan on his cell phone while away at camp, but this often led to Tom talking with Meaghan more than she talked with Jeremy. These conversations allowed Tom and Meaghan to become "like this".

	<h3>Gene Hughes</h3>
	<p>
		Gene and Jeremy met in the summer of 2004 at an orientation for the Univiersity of Maryland. Gene, however, had forgotten this encounter when Jeremy approached him on move-in day a couple months later. Despite this setback, Gene and Jeremy became friends in Wicomico Hall freshman year and have remained friends through college, working at Adele's, tailgating for Maryland games, and living together in Germantown after graduation. Together they have embarked on many endeavors, such as founded Hockey Night on Thursdays or the Heroes in a Half Shell trivia team. Alternating deftly between the maturity level of a thirty-year-old and a thirteen-year-old, Gene has endeared himself to Jeremy and Meaghan. Just don't oblige him when he responds "two ofâ€¦" to a query for the time.

	<h3>Bill Stutzman</h3>
	<p>
		Bill and Jeremy met in 2004 at the University of Maryland in Wicomico Hall. More commonly know as Stutz, he and Jeremy became friends when Jeremy finally started hanging out with the guys at the end of the hall. They spent many nights in Stutz's room freshman year playing air instruments, getting into pointless debates, and commenting on the grip location of WaWa Orange Drink. When not developing their Pizzeak&trade; and Ice business plan, they fill the hours by quoting movies, TV shows, comedians, and internet videos. Though Meaghan often inappropriately rubs Stutz's head, Jeremy does not get jealous, because his hair is just so damn soft. Seriously, it is like petting a baby duck. Give it a try.

	<h3>Chris Schade</h3>
	<p>
		Believe it or not, Carson Daly is not one of Jeremy's groomsmen. Chris, more commonly known as Scahde, met Jeremy in 2004 in the University of Maryland's Wicomico Hall. The butt of jokes and beer pong formations, he is listed last because "Schade is the worst".  In actuality, Schade is a great person and friend despite his unfortunate baseball rooting interest. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of Jock Jams and is surprisingly adept at quoting random movies. Though he moved back to New York after graduation, Schade has kept in touch by attending the Maryland homecoming tailgate each year. Regrettably, Meaghan showed some interest in Schade at one point. Fortunately for all involved, this interest went unrequited, allowing Jeremy to meet his better half.
