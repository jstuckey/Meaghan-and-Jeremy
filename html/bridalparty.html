		<h3>Kat McKeon, <em>Maid of Honor</em></h3>
		<p>
			Kat and Meaghan met in December of 1986 when Kat was born, almost exactly 9 months after Meaghan. Their friendship actually started when their dads became best friends in high school and their moms became best friends through the dads. Basically, it was fate that they became bestest friends. Growing up practically like cousins, Kat knows more embarrassing and/or awesome facts about Meaghan than pretty much anyone else. Kat and Meaghan have dedicated hours and hours to boyband and Harry Potter appreciation, passions that they still carry and bond over to this day.

		<h3>Lindsay Goetz</h3>
		<p>
			While Meaghan may have a ton of cousins, many of whom are of the female persuasion, when Lindsay was born just one month after Meaghan in 1986, she forever cemented herself in the role of same-age-girl-cousin-ally in the constant battle of girls vs. boys in the basement of Grandma Dacey’s house that was usually dominated by the boys. Even though she grew up in New Hampshire while Meaghan was in New Jersey, whenever Lindsay was around it was always a better family gathering. Through American Girl Dolls, Backstreet Boys, and one awesome trip to Ireland, Lindsay-Doodles and Meaghan have continued their strong relationship into adulthood.

		<h3>Meghan Noveck</h3>
		<p>
			When the “smart” people at Ross Street School decided to put three Me(a)g(h)and in the same first grade class in the fall of 1993, they simultaneously made some great friendships and removed any chance of those girls ever just being called “Me(a)g(h)an” again. So after Fae and Howie rebranded, the story truly begins. There were some rough years, but Fae and Howie have always been present in each others lives. (It should be noted that Fae beat Howie in the 7th grade geography bee.) The girls really hit their stride in recent years thanks to endless hours spent on gChat while at work discussing everything from weddings to what to make for dinner. Although neither really knows what to do with their longstanding nicknames with last names changing, they are sure their friendship will make it through.

		<h3>Courtney Culver</h3>
		<p>
			Courtney and Meaghan became friends in the fall of 2001 in the glorious world of 2nd period gym class. Through heated games of wiffle ball and then attending the same dance school, Courtney and Meaghan continued to grow closer to the point where Courtney attends family events, even though they’ve lived in separate states since college. Meaghan’s mom looks for Courtney’s car to pull up as soon as Meaghan gets back from Maryland. Courtney is well known for being tiny and walking on her hands and/or doing backflips pretty much anywhere.

		<h3>Liz Rosetti</h3>
		<p>
			Meaghan and Liz technically met in Mrs. Keating’s freshman English class in 2000, even working on a project together, however, Liz was so quiet and Ms. Keating so scary that Meaghan completely forgot about it until senior year. Sharing many other classes (that Meaghan actually remembers!) throughout high school, Liz and Meaghan continued to get closer and closer.

		<h3>Laura DiIorio</h3>
		<p>
			When Laura moved into the room across the hall in their freshman dorm, she and Meaghan became fast friends. Bonding over the afternoon repeats of Glimore Girls on ABC Family, Meaghan and Laura’s original roommates volunteered to switch rooms so the girls could live together for the spring semester. Meaghan and Laura spent much of their time singing Kelly Clarkson, making starburst wrapper chains, and watching Centerstage. Meaghan and Laura then spent the rest of college living together and often accidentally wearing coordinating outfits. To date, Laura is still the best roommate Meaghan’s ever had (maybe with the exception of Jeremy…maybe). Even though the girls have been in separate states since college, they still manage to find time to video chat and see each other in NYC whenever possible.

		<h3>Rebekah Stuckey</h3>
		<p>
			Rebekah and Meaghan met in 2006 when Meaghan first visited the Stuckey family house. Poor Rebekah, the youngest Stuckey, was forced to grow up with two older brothers who really seemed to enjoy picking on her. Meaghan grew up with only a younger brother. Meaghan is eagerly looking forward to having a sister and hopes Rebekah is ready for a lifetime of teaming up against Jeremy and Bryan. Jeremy’s favorite story to tell about Rebekah is that time he gave her a Gusher filled with hot sauce. No, the one where he pinned her under a stool then sat on it so she was stuck. No! The one where he filled the sink with hot water and dropped her glasses in…I think you get the picture…payback will be ours.

		<h3>Bryan Stuckey, <em>Best Man</em></h3>
		<p>
			Bryan and Jeremy met in 1988, when Bryan was born and Jeremy told his parents to "take him back." Believe it or not, Bryan is actually two years younger than Jeremy despite the height and beard growth differential. Through their formative years, they bonded over Ninja Turtles, playing outside, Nintendo, sledding, Oasis, and camping. They overcame occasional bouts of hostility, both verbal and physical, over the years to become close today. Whether attending Orioles games, hitting the ski slopes, vacationing at Deep Creek Lake, or working at Camp Oest, they are frequent companions in misadventure. Like Jake and Amir, they are Gullies For Life. Bryan was the first to inform Meaghan that she was accepted into the family since they took her crab picking, the Maryland symbol of acceptance.

		<h3>Tom Ports</h3>
		<p>
			Tom and Jeremy met in the summer of 2003 at Camp Oest when Jeremy offered to help a bowl-cut-sporting Tom with dripping candle wax into a bin of sawdust to create fire starters. They became good friends working together over the course of four summers and many events outside of camp. Whether painting the blue trail or getting a drink at Harvey's Jr., conversations inevitably turn to reminiscing about Oest, even if they repeat the same stories over and over again. They share a healthy appreciation for grilling, Natty Boh, Teva sandals, spoonerisms, random metal objects, and crab soup in a bread bowl. Tom often allowed Jeremy to call Meaghan on his cell phone while away at camp, but this often led to Tom talking with Meaghan more than she talked with Jeremy. It was these conversations that allowed Tom and Meaghan to become "like this".

		<h3>Gene Hughes</h3>
		<p>
			Gene and Jeremy met in the summer of 2004 at an orientation for the Univiersity of Maryland. Gene, however, had forgotten this encounter when Jeremy approached him on move-in day a couple months later. Despite this setback, Gene and Jeremy became friends in Wicomico Hall freshman year and have remained friends through college, working at Adele's, tailgating for Maryland games, and living together in Germantown after graduation. They have embarked on many joint ventures, be it Hockey Night on Thursdays, the Acid Rock video project, or the Heroes in a Half Shell trivia team. Alternating deftly between the maturity level of a thirty-year-old and a thirteen-year-old, Gene has endeared himself to both Jeremy and Meaghan. Just don't oblige him when he responds "two of…" to a query for the time.

		<h3>Bill Stutzman</h3>
		<p>
			Bill and Jeremy met in 2004 at the University of Maryland in Wicomico Hall. More commonly know as Stutz, he and Jeremy became friends when Jeremy finally started hanging out with the guys at the end of the hall. They spent many nights in Stutz's room freshman year playing air instruments, getting into pointless debates, and commenting on the grip location of WaWa Orange Drink. Their mutual Criminal Justice education taught them that magic can explain criminal predisposition and that Fat Curt is a claims maker. When not developing their Pizzeak&trade; and Ice business plan, they fill the hours by quoting movies, TV shows, comedians, and internet videos. Though Meaghan often inappropriately rubs Stutz's head, Jeremy does not get jealous, because his hair is just so damn soft. Seriously, it is like petting a baby duck. Give it a try.

		<h3>Chris Schade</h3>
		<p>
			Believe it or not, Carson Daly is not one of Jeremy's groomsmen. Chris, more commonly known as Scahde, met Jeremy in 2004 in the University of Maryland's Wicomico Hall. The butt of jokes and beer pong formations, he is listed last because "Schade is the worst". In actuality, Schade is a good person and friend despite his unfortunate baseball rooting interest. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of Jock Jams and is surprisingly adept at quoting random movies. If Schade mistakenly retires to your bed, just jump on him and vociferously inform him that this is not where he sleeps. Though he moved back home after graduation, he has kept in touch by attending the Maryland homecoming tailgate each season. Thanks to Schade, Meaghan was finally able to find Jeremy on Facebook after being informed that his name was not actually Jeremiah.
