		<h3>Kathleen McKeon, <em>Maid of Honor</em></h3>
		<p>
			Kat and Meaghan met in December of 1986 when Kat was born, almost exactly nine months after Meaghan. Their friendship was destined when their dads became best friends in high school, and their moms became best friends through their dads. Growing up like cousins, Kat knows more embarrassing and/or awesome facts about Meaghan than pretty much anyone else. The girls have spent countless summers on joint vacations to Ocean City, the yearly McKeon Memorial Day BBQ, and countless other random activities their mothers' schemed up over the years.  Kat and Meaghan have dedicated many hours to boyband and Harry Potter appreciation, passions they still bond over to this day.  In addition to being Meaghan's maid of honor, Kat will be taking her own walk down the aisle this April!

		<h3>Lindsay Goetz</h3>
		<p>
			Meaghan may have a ton of cousins, many of whom are of the female persuasion, but when Lindsay was born just one month after Meaghan in 1986, she forever cemented herself in the role of same-age-girl-cousin-ally. Together they fought a constant battle of girls vs. boys in the basement of Grandma Dacey’s house, a battle usually dominated by the boys. Through American Girl Dolls, Backstreet Boys, and one awesome trip to Ireland, Lindsay-Doodles and Meaghan have continued their strong relationship into adulthood.  They even got to enjoy the Dacey family rite of passage together: their first family Pub Crawl. Even though she grew up in New Hampshire while Meaghan was in New Jersey, whenever Lindsay was around, it was always a better family gathering.

		<h3>Meghan Noveck</h3>
		<p>
			When the “smart” people at Ross Street School decided to put three Me(a)g(h)ans in the same first grade class in the fall of 1993, they simultaneously made some great friendships and removed any chance of those girls being called “Me(a)g(h)an” again. After Fae and Howie rebranded, the story truly begins. There were some rough years, but Fae and Howie have always been present in each others lives. It should be noted that Fae beat Howie in the 7th grade geography bee. The girls really hit their stride in recent years thanks to endless hours spent on gChat while at work discussing everything from weddings to what to make for dinner. Although neither really knows what to do with their longstanding nicknames with last names changing, they are sure their friendship will make it through.

		<h3>Courtney Culver</h3>
		<p>
			Courtney and Meaghan became friends in the fall of 2001 in the glorious world of second period gym class. Through heated games of wiffle ball, Mortal Kombat, and attending Across the Floor, Courtney and Meaghan grew closer to the point where Courtney began attending family events. Courtney even took Meaghan's cousin to the senior prom. Meaghan’s mother looks for Courtney’s car to pull up as soon as Meaghan gets back from Maryland, and occasionally Courtney actually beats Meaghan home. Courtney is well known for being tiny, walking on her hands, and doing backflips pretty much anywhere.  Meaghan is very proud of Courtney because her boyfriend, Ed, has changed her from the girl who tries to take a straightening iron camping to a girl who owns a pink fishing pole.

		<h3>Liz Rosetti</h3>
		<p>
			Meaghan and Liz technically met in Mrs. Keating’s freshman English class in 2000, even working on a project about the Odyssey together; however, Liz was so quiet and Mrs. Keating so scary that Meaghan completely forgot about it until senior year. Sharing many other classes (that Meaghan actually remembers!) throughout high school, Liz and Meaghan continued to get closer and closer, including all going to the prom together. Liz and her husband Brian, referred to as LizandBrian, have been constant companions in Meaghan's life since high school. When Liz and Brian got married, Meaghan was lucky enough to be her bridesmaid too.  Even though Liz moved to the boonies, the girls still try to see each other as often as possible when Meaghan is home in New Jersey.

		<h3>Laura DiIorio</h3>
		<p>
			When Laura moved into the room across the hall in their freshman dorm, she and Meaghan became fast friends. Bonding over the afternoon repeats of Glimore Girls on ABC Family, Meaghan and Laura’s original roommates volunteered to switch rooms so the girls could live together for the spring semester. Meaghan and Laura spent much of their time singing Kelly Clarkson, making Starburst wrapper chains, and watching Center Stage. Meaghan and Laura then spent the rest of college living together and often accidentally wearing coordinating outfits. To date, Laura is still the best roommate Meaghan’s ever had (maybe with the exception of Jeremy... maybe). Even though the girls have been in separate states since college, they still manage to find time to video chat and see each other in NYC whenever possible.

		<h3>Rebekah Stuckey</h3>
		<p>
			Rebekah and Meaghan met in 2006 when Meaghan first visited the Stuckey family home. Poor Rebekah, the youngest sibling, was forced to grow up with two older brothers who really seemed to enjoy picking on her. Meaghan, however, grew up with only a younger brother. Meaghan is eagerly looking forward to having a sister and hopes Rebekah is ready for a lifetime of teaming up against Bryan and Jeremy. Jeremy’s favorite story to tell about Rebekah is that time he fed her a Gusher filled with hot sauce. No, the one where he pinned her under a stool and then sat on it so she was trapped. No! The one where he filled the sink with hot water and dropped her glasses in. No, no!! That time he tied her to the swing set with a jumprope and lost his jumprope privileges... I think you get the picture... payback will be ours.

		<h3>Bryan Stuckey, <em>Best Man</em></h3>
		<p>
			Bryan and Jeremy met in 1988, when Bryan was born and Jeremy told his parents to "take him back." Believe it or not, Bryan is actually two years younger than Jeremy despite the height and beard growth differential. Through their formative years, they bonded over Ninja Turtles, playing outside, Nintendo, sledding, Oasis, and camping. They overcame occasional bouts of hostility, both verbal and physical, over the years to become close today. Whether attending Orioles games, tailgating in College Park, hitting the ski slopes, vacationing at Deep Creek Lake, or working at Camp Oest, they are frequent companions in misadventure. Like Jake and Amir, they are Gullies For Life. Bryan was the first to inform Meaghan that she was accepted into the family since they took her crab picking, the Maryland symbol of acceptance.

		<h3>Tom Ports</h3>
		<p>
			Tom and Jeremy met in the summer of 2003 at Camp Oest when Jeremy offered to help a bowl-cut-sporting Tom with dripping candle wax into a bin of sawdust to create fire starters. They became good friends working together over the course of four summers and many events outside of camp. Whether painting the blue trail or getting a drink at Harvey's Jr., conversations inevitably turn to reminiscing about Oest, even if they repeat the same stories over and over again. They share a healthy appreciation for grilling, Natty Boh, Teva sandals, spoonerisms, random metal objects, and crab soup in a bread bowl. Tom often allowed Jeremy to call Meaghan on his cell phone while away at camp, but this often led to Tom talking with Meaghan more than she talked with Jeremy. It was these conversations that allowed Tom and Meaghan to become "like this".

		<h3>Thomas Fahey</h3>
		<p>
			Thomas and Jeremy met in 2006 when Jeremy first visited the family in New Jersey. The two became acquainted through various family functions, such as the annual Dacey family pub crawl. Meaghan is said to have cried when Thomas was born, aptly conforming to the theme of disappointment at a younger sibling's nativity.  At a cursory level, Thomas and Jeremy maintain different opinions on music, videogames, sports, etc.; however, each conversation reveals they have more in common than previously thought. Though Jeremy does not share Thomas' enthusiasm for soccer, Jeremy's fondness of hockey allows a certain amount of empathy for following a niche sport. Jeremy will endeavor to be a good brother-in-law by providing Thomas respite from his older sister. Let's just hope Thomas is prepared to split Christmas budget three ways.

		<h3>Gene Hughes</h3>
		<p>
			Gene and Jeremy met in the summer of 2004 at an orientation for the Univiersity of Maryland. Gene, however, had forgotten this encounter when Jeremy approached him on move-in day a couple months later. Despite this setback, Gene and Jeremy became friends in Wicomico Hall freshman year and have remained friends through college, working at Adele's, tailgating for Maryland games, trips to the beach, and living together in Germantown after graduation. They have embarked on many joint ventures, be it Hockey Night on Thursdays, the Acid Rock video project, or the Heroes in a Half Shell trivia team. Alternating deftly between the maturity level of a thirty-year-old and a thirteen-year-old, Gene has endeared himself to both Jeremy and Meaghan. Just don't oblige him when he responds "two of…" to a query for the time.

		<h3>Bill Stutzman</h3>
		<p>
			Bill and Jeremy met in 2004 at the University of Maryland in Wicomico Hall. More commonly know as Stutz, he and Jeremy became friends when Jeremy finally started hanging out with the guys at the end of the hall. They spent many nights in Stutz's room freshman year playing air instruments, getting into pointless debates, and commenting on the grip location of WaWa Orange Drink. Their mutual Criminal Justice education taught them that magic can explain criminal predisposition and that Fat Curt is a claims maker. When not developing their Pizzeak&trade; and Ice business plan, they fill the hours by quoting movies, TV shows, comedians, and internet videos. Though Meaghan often inappropriately rubs Stutz's head, Jeremy does not get jealous, because his hair is just so darn soft. Seriously, it is like petting a baby duck. Give it a try.

		<h3>Ben Franich</h3>
		<p>
			Ben and Jeremy met in 2004 when Ben stopped by Jeremy's room in Wicomico Hall and invited him to hang out. Without this exchange, Jeremy might not have met his group of college friends or met Meaghan by extension. Ben's initiative for planning the evening's activities kept the group active most weekends. Throughout college, Ben and Jeremy often stayed up late discussing topics including sports, politics, and music, even if Jeremy fabricated some of the details as they went along (Miggsy Collins: best bass player of all time). Ben has a propensity to lay out for a catch, exclaim "darggy-doo", dance like Elaine, cook burgers on the rare side, and never capitalize his fantasy football team names. Due to their similar obstinate disposition, Ben and Meaghan occasionally butted heads, but they managed to build a successful friendship on the foundation of arguing.

		<h3>Chris Schade</h3>
		<p>
			Believe it or not, Carson Daly is not one of Jeremy's groomsmen. Chris, more commonly known as Scahde, met Jeremy in 2004 in the University of Maryland's Wicomico Hall. The butt of jokes and beer pong formations, he is listed last because "Schade is the worst". In actuality, Schade is a great person and friend despite his unfortunate baseball rooting interest. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of Jock Jams and is surprisingly adept at quoting random movies. If Schade mistakenly retires to your bed, just jump on him and vociferously inform him that this is not where he sleeps. Despite moving back home after graduation, Schade keeps in touch by attending the Maryland homecoming tailgate each season. Thanks to Schade, Meaghan was finally able to find Jeremy on Facebook after being informed that his name was not actually Jeremiah.
